# Friends Group Stories

This is a simple static website showing short friend profiles, now with a neon-styled header and subtle animated particle effects (see `script.js`).

Open the site locally by opening `index.html` in your browser, or serve it with a simple HTTP server:

PowerShell / Command Prompt:
```
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Accessibility: If you prefer reduced motion, enable the "Reduce motion" setting in your OS or browser — the site respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Let me know if you want:
- Photos for each friend (I can add placeholders or upload images)
- A printable card per friend
- A shareable link (I can help deploy to GitHub Pages)
